# Create a function called text_analyzer that takes a single string argument and displays
# the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters and
# spaces.
# • If None or nothing is provided, the user is prompted to provide a string.
# • If the argument is not a string, print an error message.
# • This function must have a docstring explaning its behavior.
# Test your function with the python console

# Docstrings act as documentation for the class, module, and packages.
# On the other hand, Comments are mainly used to explain non-obvious portions
#  of the code and can be useful for comments on Fixing bugs and tasks 
#  that are needed to be done.
